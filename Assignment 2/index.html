            <p>The first known act of a suicidal attempt goes far back towards 600 B.C. Since then, Suicide has become synonymous towards society, with deaths as high as 800,000 per year. Has Suicide Rate stabilised over the years?
              Following World Mental Health Day, this visualisation aims to explore the change in suicide rates over the course of 3 decades. Factors 
              such as Countries, Age Group, Population and Gender will be the basis of the exploration.</p>

            <h2>Overall Suicide Rates per 100k population across the World</h2>
            <p>Firstly, we explore the overall trend of suicide rate across the world. 
              On first glance, the darkened area around <b> Russia </b> suggests its high suicide rate – 
              a staggering <b> 32.25 </b> suicides per 100,000 population.</p>
            <p> The neighbouring country, <b> Kazakhstan </b> can also 
              be seen having a high suicide rate – around <b> 29 </b>suicides per 100,000 population. </p>
            <p> Some notable mentions of countries with high suicide rates include <b> Canada </b> (<b> 13 </b>
              suicides / 100k population), <b> USA </b> (<b> 20 </b> suicides/100k population) and <b> Korea </b>
              (<b> 35 </b> suicides / 100k population).</p>

          <h2>Average Suicide Rates per 100k population across different Age Groups</h2>
          <p>Here, we can see that the overall trend of suicide rates has not changed from 1979, 
            remaining at around ten suicides/100k population. Upon further exploration, 
            we can see that elderly age groups of age 75 and above have the highest suicide rates, 
            reaching a maximum of 30 suicides/100k population in 1995. The graph has since then shown a 
            decreasing trend.  Younger age groups such as those from 5 – 14 years old are least worrying, 
            with rates stabilizing at less than one suicide / 100k population. The remaining age groups have 
            shown an overall decrease in suicide rates, however not by much as rates remain between 5 – 15 
            suicides / 100k population.</p>

            <h2>Top 10 Countries with Highest Suicide Rate per Age Group</h2>
            <p>Russia dominates this chart with values reaching as high as 200 suicides per 100k population 
              during the course of 3 decades. As mentioned above, we can also see higher suicide rates on the 
              75+ age group, especially on Korea where an average rate of 69 suicides could be seen for this 
              age group. </p>

          <h2>Gender on its impact towards Suicide Rates</h2>
          <p>Data for this part has been categorized into intervals of 3 years, and it is apparent that throughout 
            the years, Male tend to have a higher suicide rate as compared to Females. Throughout 3 decades, there hasn’t 
            been an interval where Females have had a higher suicide rate than Males. Suicide Rates reached an all-time 
            high for Males on the interval 1994-1996, where it recorded an average of 24 suicides, while Females had an 
            average rate of 6 suicides. The overall trend of suicides rates on Males has since decreased, however, its 
            values are still relatively high when compared to rates of Female Suicide Rates by around 4x. Females, 
            on the other hand, has kept its overall rate stagnant at an average of 5 suicides throughout 3 decades.</p>
